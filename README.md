Basic Python Projects
This repository is for The Tech Academy's Python course. It displays projects that I made using Python. They use various modules such as tkinter or sqlite3.

Projects:

Phonebook
Check Files Gui
Phonebook

This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.

Check Files Gui

This project allows the user to choose and transfer all .txt files (that were modified within the last 24 hours) from one chosen directory to another. All files that are moved will be saved in a database.
